line of digits = bank of batteries of a specific "joltage"
turn on 2 batteries. joltage is the number created by the digits. 2 & 4 is 24
find largest joltage possible for each bank
total is sum

987654321111111 = 98
811111111111119 = 89
234234234234278 = 78
818181911112111 = 92

sum = 357

part 2:
12 digit number
987654321111 + 811111111119 + 434234234278 + 888911112111 = 3121910778619

monotonic decreasing stack
to get k largest digits, remove n smallest digits.
